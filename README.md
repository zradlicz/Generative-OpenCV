# Generative-OpenCV
My first experiments with generative art and creative coding. Every project is done using OpenCV as a drawing canvas, intended to improve my image processing skills.


## Folder Layout
Folder | Contents
------------ | -------------
Boid | A flocking simulation, bird-oids
Video Writer | Program to write video from folder of images
Diffusion Limited Aggregation | random walkers colliding with a seed creates fractaline shapes
Fractional Brownian Motion | A way to create noise
Mycelium | Implementation of a physarum (slime mold) simulation
Perlin Noise | Experiments in using perlin noise to create natural looking shapes'
L-Systems | L-systems to generate either stochastic or deterministic branching shapes
Diffusion-Reaction | Simulation of two chemicals diffusing and reacting with eachother
Circle Packing | Creating circles that don't overlap

![Flow Diagram](images/flow_diagram.jpg)

This is a flow diagram of all of the software. Use it to follow along with the AutoTrim main loop.

![Output](/images/example_output.JPG)

This image is an example of the output you should get from running AutoTrim. From top left: RGB image, Depth image, shape difference, prediction, thresholded prediction, depth prediciton.


![Probe Toolpath](/images/probe_toolpath.JPG)

This image shows the data collected from the probe overlayed onto the shape of the segmented shape.

![Probe Analysis](/images/probe_analyzed.JPG)

This image shows the edge detection working on the probe data.
